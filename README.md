### Phase 1
This is where we did some feature engineering, cleaning and exploratory data analysis on our dataset.

### Phase 2
Here we trained our ML models on our cleaned dataset. ML models/algorithms we utilized were KNN, Kmeans, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression

### Phase 3
In this directory, we created the simple data app with streamlit to allow users to user our models to gain some understanding (e.g. similar jobs or salary) about certain jobs they query.
